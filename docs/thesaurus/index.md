# Thesaurus Editing

There are numerous ways to edit Code Thesaurus depending on your skill set or time commitment!

The main ways are:

* Correcting incorrect information on the site
* [Filling in information that's missing (like a language that doesn't have a concept/structure yet)](../thesaurus/add-lang-concept.md)
* [Adding a new programming language into the system](../thesaurus/add-new-lang.md)
* [Adding a new concept/structure (i.e. functions, namespaces, etc.) into the system](../thesaurus/add-new-structure.md)
* [Updating information to reflect a new version of a programming language](../thesaurus/add-new-lang-version.md)

There are also some [best practices](../thesaurus/best-practices.md) that have been standardized as the project has grown to help keep things consistent. We recommend people review those while contributing.

Also check out how the [contributing process](../thesaurus/contributing.md) works.
